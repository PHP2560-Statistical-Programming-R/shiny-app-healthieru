## Initial Feedback 12/10/2017

- This app looks like it will work well.
- A similar type app was done in Spring 2016.
    - You may want to use that as guidance
- To make this type of app work well pay attention to the visuals of it. 
- You have a lot of information on one tab. I would suggest a tabbed layout with maybe the following tabs:
      - Instructions
      - Enter Personal Information
      - BMI Analysis
      - Workout Analysis
- It runs well and looks good, your ggplot graphic does have the text boxes cut off on the right hand edges. 


## Feedback from Class Presentation

### What your classmates liked:

- useful and clear
- Very useful app.
- Interesting idea that could definitely be useful for people who want to lose weight.
- Incorporates lots of variables as input
- There is great potential for this app to help people gauge their health based on BMI, and it was very - well done in terms of displaying useful information for weight loss. 
- This app has interesting topic and the users can get useful information from that. And it can make private schedule for people. The graphs are nice and readable. 
- Remind me that I should start working out and losing weight.
- I liked the concept of this app and I like that you included realistic considerations for the use (ex: - you can't set a goal of loosing to much weight to quickly)
- There is an instruction tab, which makes the app more readable. And this app can do regression analysis and give workout options for overweight people. Also the BMI graph helps the audience to find a target BMI based on current BMI.
- I like the topic they chose and the various amounts of activities that were included in it
how it calculate the amount  and type of training needed based on weight and BMI 
- Function and detail
- I like that the app evolved a simple concept (BMI) to a very useful, innovative application.
- Their app can give suggestions on individuals level and seems have collected a lot of information.
- I liked the use of graphs, statistics, and most importantly the workout analysis to recommend users healthy weight targets and different workout plans
- I think it's cool how the app checks to see if the weight loss goals are too extreme. The graphs showing weight distribution looked nice.
- Very interesting topic.
- It was easier to use the app
- Good idea. Useful in our daily life.
- It was the app my group created. The visuals my team and I incorporated took a lot of effort and I think it was interesting people in the class wanted to put it to use. 
- The work analysis is very cool, I think it is definitely an important piece 
- very interactive and comprehensive graphs
- Useful for those who need a starting point to lose weight. It warns you that a weight loss program is not for those who are underweight
- interesting topic and useful workout plan app
- useful UX utilities - it's nice that u have incorporated unit conversion for different countries (kg and pounds)
- nice graph and nice layout"
- The usefulness and collaboration
- It's practical because many people are trying to lose weight.



### What they suggest for changes


- bare design
- General ui, title panel and larger fonts on main page. Maybe not “weight loss program” per se, perhaps a Healthier U Calculator / Measurer? 
- A description of the functionality of the app would definitely help.
- Add more variables such as age
- It might be easier if there were options for users to input rather than slide the measurements instead (sometimes sliding to a precise measure can be hard). More information in workout analysis (e.g., is this assuming exercising every day for the weight loss?) would be helpful. 
- I think the layout of the app can be improved. 
- Recommend appropriate food for different kinds of people and show how to cook healthy meal for yourself.
- aesthetically the app is very plain and it seems like there is a bit too much white space - maybe you could make tables and output bigger or change the layout so that the data and graphs you are presenting nicely fill the screen
- I think maybe it would be more convenient to use the app if the BMI analysis graph can be placed together with the Personal Information. So that after inputing the personal information, the audience can directly get the graph and don't need to switch the tab.
- Maybe improve the layout of the tables. make it more visually appealing
- arrangement of tables 
- maybe more visualizations regarding the user's health information compared to a national average etc.
- More varieties of exercises could be added.
- Maybe they can include suggestions on how much calorie each individual should  intake.
- I thought it was smart to use a regression model. Perhaps it’d be helpful to explain the model in the instructions tab to have information on how the weight is computed  
- I think text input would make more sense than slider bars.
- It would be better for them to put plot and data input together.
- Hide the error message in the output panel. For example hide "unused argument (`Calories Per Hour` = burn.rate)"
- Design
- Not too sure, if there is any more feedback we will gladly change stuff. 
- A pie chart breaking up a work out routine into time spent and calories burned would be great! No one is going to do push ups for an hour, it would be nice to have a routine built based on some preferences.
- I think they need a quick introduction for the app
- An explanation for the exercises
- Label the graph
- The workflow could be improved. I had to put in extra effort to get it to run. 
- Bugs need to be fixed because I cannot open the last two items on navbarpage. Maybe the file path should be changed.





## Before turning it n fix this:

- Many suggested that it seemed a bit plain, try and change some font sizes and layouts to maximize the space
- Some suggested a Calorie intake calculator to help make changes, I would look into this as it seems useful
- Label the graphs
- Make sure no extra work is needed to run the app. 
- Hide any error messages
